            <h2>Experience:</h2>
                <p>2020-Present: Working as a Tea Assisstant in a Residential Care Home. </p>
                <p>I was employed as a Tea Assisstant to help in the Kitchen in making, serving and cleaning dishes, cups and trays that the residents use. I'm also responsible in inputting what they have eaten/drank and time they had it. Overall, this helped me improve my capacity to remember massive amount of information and work quickly in a fast paced environment. </p>
                <p>2014-2016: Worked as a Pharmacy Assisstant in a family business.</p>
                <p>For 2 years, I worked in my family's business as a Phramacy Assisstant where I helped make sure all stocks are available, not yet expired and in good condition. This helped me work under pressure as many people needed medicine everyday and making sure the right medicine was administered.</p>
