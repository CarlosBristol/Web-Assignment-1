        <h2>Module Experience</h2>
        <p>Starting this module up, I did not have any kind of web coding knowledge so everything was new to me. It was more of an independent course where I had to figure things out on my own than people telling me the solution which was the most difficult part. However, it did help me fully understand the Module's Topics (what they do, why there are used and when you should not). Furthermore, the assistance I acquired from my lecturer, his videos, extra support session and my fellow coursemates allowed me to complete this assignment. In the end, I enjoyed experimenting with my website and how these additions/changes evolved it over time.  </p>
        
        <h2>Website Layout Design</h2>
        <p>I chose to design my website like this as I wanted to make it simple, clear and easy to understand for anyone viewing this site for quick navigation.</p>
        <img src="Home Page Design.png" alt="Home Page Design">
        <p>This is the starting web layout for my Home Page which I kept the same with my other pages as shown below.</p>

        <h2>Website Pages Design</h2>
        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <img src="Home Page Full Design.png" alt="Home Page Full Design">
        <p>With my Home Page, I just wanted it to only contain an image of myself with a brief info on who I am and what my website contains in the centre of the page.</p>
        
        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <img src="Portfolio Full Design.png" alt="Portfolio Full Design">
        <p>With my Portfolio Page, I separated the screen to 3 grids so that each row will have 3 images (each image has a brief caption on what the image is).</p>
    
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <img src="Contact Full Design.png" alt="Contact Full Design">
        <p>With my Contact Page, I added 3 input fields (Name, Email and Message) also a submit button at the buttom which will launch my email when pressed.
        
        <h2>CV</h2>
        <img src="CV Full Design.png" alt="CV Full Design">
        <p>With my CV Page, I separated it into 2 grids to have 2 columns. I added my name, my image, list of skills, who am I, list of interests and experience. With the 2 grid columns it helped make it look more of a CV and not just everything in 1 line (e.g. like a word document) and looks much neater which is why I chose to make it like this.
